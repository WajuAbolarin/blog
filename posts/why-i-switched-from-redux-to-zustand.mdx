After two years of maintaining a Redux-heavy frontend, I made the call to migrate to Zustand. Here's what I learned.

## The boilerplate problem

Redux Toolkit improved things significantly, but we still had action creators, reducers, selectors, and middleware — each in their own files. For a team of five, the cognitive overhead was real.

```typescript
// Zustand store - everything in one place
const useAuthStore = create((set) => ({
  user: null,
  isLoading: false,
  login: async (credentials) => {
    set({ isLoading: true })
    const user = await api.login(credentials)
    set({ user, isLoading: false })
  },
}))
```

## What I miss about Redux

DevTools. Redux DevTools are genuinely excellent — time travel debugging, action replay, state diffing. Zustand has devtools middleware, but it's not quite the same level of polish.

## The verdict

For most apps, Zustand's simplicity wins. If you need complex middleware chains or time-travel debugging, Redux still has a place. But for us, the reduction in boilerplate and mental overhead was worth the tradeoff.

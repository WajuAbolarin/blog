When you're running services across multiple machines, the first thing that breaks is your ability to understand what's happening. Traditional logging — printing strings to stdout — doesn't cut it anymore. You need structure.

Over the past year at Taxfix, I've been working on improving our observability stack. We moved from unstructured log lines to JSON-structured logs with correlation IDs, and the difference in debugging speed has been dramatic.

## The problem with unstructured logs

Consider a typical microservice architecture. A single user request might touch five different services. When something goes wrong, you're left grepping through logs on five different machines, trying to correlate timestamps and hoping the clocks are synced.

```typescript
// Before: unstructured logging
console.log('User login failed')

// After: structured logging
logger.error('auth.login.failed', {
  userId: req.userId,
  correlationId: req.correlationId,
  reason: 'invalid_credentials'
})
```

The key insight is that structured logs aren't just for machines — they're for your future self at 3am trying to figure out why payments are failing. Every log entry should answer: what happened, to whom, and in what context.

## Correlation IDs: the missing link

A correlation ID is a unique identifier that gets passed through every service involved in handling a request. Once you search for it, you get the complete story of a request across your entire system. This single pattern transformed our incident response time.

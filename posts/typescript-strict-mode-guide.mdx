Enabling `strict: true` in an existing TypeScript project feels overwhelming. Here's how to do it incrementally without losing your mind.

## Start with individual flags

Don't flip `strict` to `true` all at once. Enable flags one at a time: start with `noImplicitAny`, then `strictNullChecks`, then the rest. Each flag catches a different category of bugs.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "strictNullChecks": true,
    "strictFunctionTypes": true,
    "strictBindCallApply": true
  }
}
```

## strictNullChecks is the big one

This single flag catches more bugs than all the others combined. It forces you to handle `null` and `undefined` explicitly, which eliminates an entire class of runtime errors. Yes, you'll add a lot of `if` checks and optional chaining. That's the point.

## The escape hatches

Use `as` assertions and `!` non-null assertions sparingly, but don't be afraid of them during migration. Mark them with `// TODO: strict` comments so you can come back and fix them properly. Pragmatism beats purity.

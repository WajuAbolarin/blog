Most technical documentation is written for the author, not the reader. Here's how to fix that.

## Start with the reader's context

Before writing, ask: what does the reader know, and what do they need to accomplish? An onboarding guide for a new team member is fundamentally different from an API reference for an experienced developer, even if they cover the same system.

## The four types of documentation

Every docs page should be exactly one of: tutorial, how-to guide, explanation, or reference. Mixing these types is why most documentation feels confusing. A tutorial walks someone through a learning experience. A how-to guide solves a specific problem. An explanation provides background and context. A reference is a dry, complete description of the system.

## Write the error messages first

The best documentation I've ever written wasn't in a docs site — it was in error messages. A good error message tells you what went wrong, why, and how to fix it. If your error messages are that good, you need less documentation.

After working on Vue apps with 200+ components, I've settled on a structure that scales without becoming a maze.

## Feature folders over type folders

Don't organize by type (`components/`, `stores/`, `composables/`). Organize by feature. Everything related to authentication lives in `features/auth/` — components, composables, stores, types, and tests.

```
src/
  features/
    auth/
      AuthForm.vue
      useAuth.ts
      auth.store.ts
      auth.types.ts
      __tests__/
    dashboard/
      DashboardView.vue
      useMetrics.ts
      widgets/
  shared/
    components/
    composables/
    utils/
```

## Shared vs feature code

Code starts in a feature folder. Only move it to `shared/` when a second feature needs it. Premature abstraction into `shared/` creates a junk drawer that nobody wants to maintain.

## Naming conventions

Be boringly consistent. Components are PascalCase. Composables start with `use`. Stores end with `.store.ts`. Types end with `.types.ts`. Tests mirror source structure. When every file follows the same pattern, you can find anything without searching.

Vue 3's Composition API changed how we think about state management. Here are the patterns that have worked well for our team.

## Composables as state containers

The simplest pattern is a composable that holds reactive state. No library needed.

```typescript
const state = reactive({ count: 0, items: [] })

export function useCounter() {
  const increment = () => state.count++
  const decrement = () => state.count--
  return { count: readonly(toRef(state, 'count')), increment, decrement }
}
```

## When to reach for Pinia

Composables work great for local or feature-scoped state. When you need devtools, SSR hydration, or state that multiple unrelated components share, Pinia is the right call. The key is knowing the boundary — don't reach for a state management library when a simple composable will do.
